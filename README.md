## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JS, Nodes.js, Express, MongoDB

This project was built using Node.js, Express and EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating) for more dynamic programming. This website also utilizes Passport, Mongoose, and Morgan(logger).

## Lessons Learned: 

This project was good practice in understanding Express and the capabilities of mongoDB. I feel much more comfortable working with EJS and look forward to working with other templating languages and creating more dynamic CRUD apps.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:1978`
